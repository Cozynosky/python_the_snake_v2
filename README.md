Introduction
============
Some time ago, when I started to learn python I made a snake game in console what was not bad but I wanted something more
so when I've learnt some pygame module I wonderend what game could I make so better version of my old project was prefect idea.

Game mechanics
-------------
It's literally just classic snake game, where snake can eat apples which increase your score, snake will die when hit the wall or 
eat itself. Your high score is stored in a file what is kind a good feature.

Controls
-------------
To control snake you can use arrows or wasd.
